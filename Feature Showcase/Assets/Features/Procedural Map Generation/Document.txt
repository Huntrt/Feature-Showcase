# Digger:
	Process: (+ Process | > Action | "" Variable | ? Possible | $ Condition)
		+ Set Plot:
			> The "plot" that handle digging an new "plot" will know as "miner".
			> The "miner" will decide an random direction to dig an new "plot".
			> The newly dig "plot" will be know as the new "miner"...
			? If during dig the following condition meet:
				$ All 4 direction of "miner" are digged. 
				$ Still need more "plot".
				> Choose an random direction and bypass them until no longer on digged "plot".
				> Set "miner" from there...

		+ Decide Neighbor:
			> An "plot" has list of 4 "neighbor" for each direction.
			> Each "neighbor" will has "digByThis" and "hasDig":
				digByThis = This "neighbor" has been dig by this "plot".
				hasDig    = This "neighbor" has been dig.
			> When an "miner" digged an new "plot" it will mark that newly dig as "digByThis" in it "neighbor".
			> Go through all the "plot" to check 4 direction of that "plot".
			> If there is digged "plot" in that direction then mark it as "hasDig" in it "neighbor".
			> When check "neighbor" the "plot" will also store that "neighbor" important data.

		+ Building Bridge:
			> Go through all the "plot" then get "connection" for each of them to "bridge".
			> How to get "connection" are depend on what mode the user choose:
				? Adjacent   = All "plot" will has bridge connect to it "neighbor".
				? Generation = "Bridge" will connect base on how it was dig.
				? Randomize  = "Plot" will randomly choose an "neighbor" to "bridge" to.
			> Check if all it "connection" has get are "hasDig" and it not duplicate.
			> Format "bridge" such as it position, scaling, etc... for all "connection" has get.
			> Buid "bridge" using format info.
			> Create "railing" at bridge position modify with half of bridge width and wall thick.
			> "Railing" modify and scale are base on direction of bridge it create.

		+ Building Floor:
			> Create "floor" object on each "plot".
			> Check through each "plot" "neighbor" to create "barrier".
			> Create "barrier" when there is not an "neighbor".
			? Create "barrier" when there is an "neighbor".
			> If "neighbor" have "bridge".
			> Beign build "barrier" that act as "gate"
			> Align "gate" to be middle between "bridge" edge and "floor" edge on each side.
			? If an "barrier" poke into floor (when not barricade "neighbor"):
				> Cut the part that poke in
				> Move it in the opposite direction it poke.

	Limit: ( (X) important)
		- (1) Only support square floor.
		- (8) wall work with an single stretch object.
		- (4) Auto scale don't affect gate.
		- (5) Can't edit barrier and railing length individual.
		- (6) Land mode could cause wall clip in each other if place diagonal.
