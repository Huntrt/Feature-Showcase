# Digger:
	Process:
		+ Set Plot:
			> The "plot" that handle digging an new "plot" will know as "miner".
			> The "miner" will decide an random direction to dig an new "plot".
			> The newly dig "plot" will be know as the new "miner"...
			> If during dig the following condition meet:
				- All 4 direction of "miner" are digged. 
				- Still need more "plot".
				> Choose an random direction and go until no longer on digged "plot".
				> Set "miner" from there...
		+ Decide Neighbor:
			> An "plot" has list of 4 neighbor for each direction.
			> Each neighbor will has digByThis and hasDig:
				digByThis = This neighbor has been dig by this "plot".
				hasDig = This neighbor has been dig.
			> When an "miner" digged an new "plot" it will mark that newly dig as "digByThis" in it neighbor.
			> Go through all the "plot" to check 4 direction of that "plot".
			> If there is digged "plot" then mark it as "hasDig" in neighbor.
